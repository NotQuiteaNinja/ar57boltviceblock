AR57 Vice Block for BCG

Based on the work 20000RadsUnderTheSea did with the AR-57 bolt modifications to get the Super Safety to work I decided to make a vice block that would help DIYers do the modification themselves. 

This is a single object- duplicate it and print two. Print however you desire. I printed laying down on the flat side with PA6-CF and 50% infill, I'm sure other materials will work fine.
